The official WordPress plugin for <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a>. Automated management of your awesome Pressgram images!

== Description ==

The official WordPress plugin for <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a>. De-clutters the home page / home screen from all those awesome images you're posting! Auto-categorizes images uploaded to your site from Pressgram and applies presets  to these posts (post type, post status, post format, featured image control, image alignment, image link, comment status, ping status, hashtag to post tag translation, and removal of specific content). Power tags allow you to control posting options directly from the app. The widget allows you to display your recent images in the sidebar. Oh, and it also encourage digital publishers to be <strong>rebels with a cause</strong>. Viva la revoluciÃ³n!

This plugin allows you to select a category that will be used for your Pressgram photos (bottom of Settings Panel >> Media). It will ...

1. auto-categorize all Pressgram posts to this selected category,
1. remove those photos from showing up on the main feed (homepage) and rss feed of your blog,
1. apply your custom fine control settings to each Pressgram post, and
1. allow you to display recent photos via the widget (provided they are set as a featured image).

Note, that photos will continue to display in your search and in your archives. Options are available to allow photos on your home page and/or in your RSS feed (for yummy SEO inclusion!).

Power users can make use of power tags. Use the following tags in posts from app and you can control how your content is published and displayed:

* **_t:post-type**  (post-type must be an existing post type slug: ex. post, attachment)
* **_s:post-status**  (post-status options include: publish, pending, draft, private)
* **_f:post-format**  (post-format must be a supported post format: ex. image, aside, standard)
* **_i:featured-image**  (featured-image must be either t or f and will control featured image assignment)
* **_a:image-alignment**  (image-alignment options: left, center, right, none)
* **_l:image-link**  (image-link options: link, post, none)
* **_c:comment-status**  (comment status must be t or f)
* **_p:ping-status**  (ping status must be t or f)
* **_h:hashtag-to-post-tag-translation**  (hashtag-to-post-tag must be t or f)
* **_r:removal-of-content**  (remove content options: hashtags, text, image)
