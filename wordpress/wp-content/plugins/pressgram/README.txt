The official WordPress plugin for Pressgram. Automated management of Pressgram posts helps you publish pictures worth 1,000 words!

== Description ==

Our mission is to publish pictures worth 1,000 words. The official WordPress plugin for <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a> allows you automated management of the many awesome images you post to your own blog from the Pressgram app.

= What does the plugin do? =
Once activated and configured, the Pressgram plugin will handle all incoming posts from Pressgram. It will ...

* Auto-categorize the post to the category selected during setup.
* Apply fine control settings according to your custom setup and any powertags you've defined.
* Feature Pressgram images via a simple and clean Pressgram widget.
* Write metadata to your database identifying the post and the image as from Pressgram.

= How do I set up the plugin? =
Upon activation, the plugin will prompt you to configure settings for Pressgram management. *(found at Settings > Media)*

1. Select a category that will be auto-assigned to your Pressgram posts. *(note: no need to assign this category in-app)*
1. Define custom fine control settings to handle your Pressgram posts. *(note: override settings in-app via powertags)*
1. Enable post types for which you would like to allow Pressgram relation.
1. If desired, add the Pressgram widget to sidebars.

= What fine control settings are included? =
The following fine control presets are customizable to your blog:

* Show/hide Pressgram defined category posts from home page.
* Show Pressgram defined category posts on home page only if they also contain at least one additional category.
* Show/hide Pressgram defined category posts from rss feeds.
* Show Pressgram defined category posts in feeds only if they also contain at least one additional category.
* Post Type: select from available post types or select 'Unattached Media'
* Post Status: select from Published, Pending, Draft, or Private
* Post Format: select from available post formats
* Featured Image Control: set as featured image *(or not)*
* Image Alignment: select from Left, Center, Right, or None
* Image Link: select from Media File, Attachment Page, or None
* Comment Status: allow or disallow
* Trackback Status: allow or disallow
* Hashtag Translation: translate hashtags to post tags
* Post Content Removal: options to remove hashtags, non-hashtag text, and/or the image

= How do post relations and the widget work? =
Pressgram post relation is created for all posts made from Pressgram. Post relation can be broken or created for posts by use of the checkbox found in the Publish metabox of posts. The widget allows you to display from 1 to 16 images in a grid of one to four columns for recent posts that are related to Pressgram. Images link to the associated Pressgram post on your blog.

= What are powertags? =
Powertags allow you in-app control of how the plugin will process a single Pressgram post. Use the following tags in-app and you control how your content is published and displayed:

* **_t:post-type**  (post-type must be an existing post type slug: ex. post, attachment)
* **_s:post-status**  (post-status options include: publish, pending, draft, private)
* **_f:post-format**  (post-format must be a supported post format: ex. image, aside, standard)
* **_i:featured-image**  (featured-image must be either t or f and will control featured image assignment)
* **_a:image-alignment**  (image-alignment options: left, center, right, none)
* **_l:image-link**  (image-link options: link, post, none)
* **_c:comment-status**  (comment status must be t or f)
* **_p:ping-status**  (ping status must be t or f)
* **_h:hashtag-translation**  (hashtag-translation must be t or f)
* **_r:removal-of-content**  (remove content options: hashtags, text, image)

A new video showing plugin use (w/ it's recently added feature set) is in the works! Check back soon.

= Understanding the Metadata =

Prior to Version 2.0.5, Pressgram posts and image attachments were not tagged with metadata. However, as of Version 2.0.5, each post and image attachment is tagged with metadata identifying it's source as the Pressgram app. This metadata is now used to query images for display in the Pressgram widget. In future versions, it may be used for other features. If you would like to tag your existing Pressgram posts and image attachments with the necessary metadata, do one of the following:

**Adding _pressgram_post and _pressgram_image metadata:**

1. Insert the following code in your theme's functions.php file.
1. Define the array containing post IDs.
1. Define the array containing attachment IDs.
1. Deactivate the Pressgram plugin.
1. Reactivate the Pressgram plugin.
1. Remove the code from your theme's functions.php file.

`/**
 * Add Pressgram metadata to specific posts
 * Note: Posts via Pressgram prior to use of v2.0.5 do not contain metadata
 */
function add_pressgram_meta() {
	// Array of post ids which you would like to mark as a Pressgram post
	// e.g. $post_ids = array( 2, 7, 14, 16, 19 );
	$post_ids = array(  );

	// Array of attachment ids which you would like to mark as a Pressgram image
	// e.g. $image_ids = array( 1, 6, 13, 15, 18 );
	$image_ids = array(  );

	// Loop through posts and add metadata
	foreach ( $post_ids as $post_id ) {
		add_post_meta( $post_id, '_pressgram_post', TRUE, TRUE );
	}

	// Loop through images and add metadata
	foreach ( $image_ids as $image_id ) {
		add_post_meta( $image_id, '_pressgram_image', TRUE, TRUE );
	}
}
// Do this on Pressgram plugin activation
add_action( 'activate_pressgram/pressgram.php', 'add_pressgram_meta' );`

**Adding/Removing _pressgram_post metadata:**

As of Version 2.1.0, you can add/remove _pressgram_post metadata by enabling Post Relation on the settings screen and checking/unchecking the Pressgram Post option in the Publish metabox.
