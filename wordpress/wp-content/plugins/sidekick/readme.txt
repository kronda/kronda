== Description ==

**SIDEKICK**

The Sidekick Plugin for WordPress brings over 40 Walkthroughs for the WordPress Core right to your Dashboard. Each Walkthrough will guide you step-by-step through a task like creating a post or installing a new plugin!

Sidekick will also detect the plugins and themes you have active and push any related walkthroughs in the library, right to your Dashboard.

**Think [Clippy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant "Clippy"), but useful!**

**HOW DOES IT WORK?**

The [Sidekick](http://Sidekick.pro/ "Sidekick") platform provides **real-time, voice-guided support and learning** from within any html or PHP based web application or CMS. Support is provided through modules called "Walkthroughs”" that guide users through everything from understanding simple aspects of an application to completing even complicated tasks.

Walkthroughs are served directly from the Sidekick library. With the user’s permission, an installed Sidekick module can automatically detect a user’s access level, installed 3rd party extensions and settings. That information is used to pull the appropriate walkthroughs from the Sidekick library. Sidekick also collects anonymous user data (with the user’s permission) to track, amongst other things, which walkthroughs are attempted and completed and how often.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Unzip and upload the Sidekick plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You will see a Help button appear in the bottom right corner of your Dashboard.

= So is it Sidekick for WordPress or WPUniversity? =

Well. Both.

Sidekick is the web based platform that created the plugin code, stores walkthroughs and operates the library. WPUniversity writes and creates the Core WordPress Walkthroughs for the Sidekick for WordPress plugin.

= What is a Sidekick Walkthrough? =

A Sidekick for WordPress Walkthrough is a real-time, guided tutorial that walks you step by step through completing a task inside your WordPress Dashboard. It’s as if your site-builder or theme developer were standing right there with you, helping you get it done.

= What are Core and 3rd Party WordPress Walkthroughs? =

When we say “Core Walkthroughs” for WordPress, we are referring to any support and learning that has to do with features and functions provided by a fresh, default install of WordPress, downloaded from WordPress.org. Basically, if a walkthrough is helping you complete a standard WordPress function like creating a post, it’s a Core Walkthrough and WPUniversity created it.

Plugin and theme specific Walkthroughs are called Third Party Walkthroughs and are created and maintained by the plugin or theme creator, unless otherwise mentioned.

= How do I create Walkthroughs for my Plugin(s) or Theme(s)? =

At the moment Sidekick Composer, the tool we use to create Walkthroughs, is for in-house use only but we plan for that to change by the end of December 2013. If you’re interested in getting a head start, send us an email at info@wpuniversity.com and we’ll let you know how you can get started.

= What does Sidekick for WordPress cost? =

The Sidekick plugin for WordPress is and always will be free to download and use. Installing the plugin gives you instant and unlimited access to at least 5 Core WordPress Walkthroughs as well as Walkthroughs created for any plugins or themes that are installed and active on your WordPress site.
If you would like access to the full library of Core WordPress Walkthroughs (40+) the cost is $20 per month per user. Price discounts start at just two licenses and go up from there.

For now, access to all 40+ Core Walkthroughs is FREE of charge!

= Ok, the plugin is installed and activated. How do I use it? =

Click on the little icon in the bottom right of your screen to open the Walkthrough menu. (Think Clippy, only useful.)
You will be presented with the Walkthrough menu. Select your category then your walkthrough and away you go.

= Can I suggest a Walkthrough that I’d like to see or give you feedback on the Sidekick WordPress Plugin? =

Absolutely. In fact, we rely on users like you  to tell us about things that need to be improved or that you’d like to see added to the plugin. Send your email to info@wpuniversity.com. We read and respond to every piece of feedback we get.

= Are Sidekick and WPUniversity the same company? =

[WPUniversity](http://wpuniversity.com/ "WPUniversity") and [Sidekick](http://Sidekick.pro/ "Sidekick") are created, owned and managed by [FlowPress Inc.](http://flowpress.ca/ "FlowPress"), a Toronto based Web Development Agency and startup.
