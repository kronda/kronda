The ShortPixel plugin reduces the images' size making your website load faster. Image quality is preserved using advanced compression technology.

== Description ==

ShortPixel is an image compression tool that helps improve your website performance. The plugin optimises images automatically using both lossy and lossless compression. Resulting, smaller, images are no different in quality from the original.

ShortPixel uses powerful algorithms that enable your website to load faster, use less bandwidth and rank better in search. The unique API key you receive for activating the plugin can be used for multiple websites.

**The ShortPixel package includes:**

* **Both lossy and lossless optimisation:** you can choose between the two types of compression. Lossy for photographs. Lossless for technical drawings, clip art and comics.
* **One API Key for multiple sites:** after registration, you receive an API key that you can further use on several websites or applications.
* **Up to 90% compression rate:** with lossy compression images that were 3MB can crunch to 307Kb, with no before/after differences..
* **Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, PDF, both static and animated GIFS. NEW UPDATE: we recently introduced optimisation for PDFs.
* **Backup and restore originals:** if you ever want to return to the original version, images are automatically stored in a backup folder on your hosting servers.
* **Bulk image optimisation:** Crunch your image gallery, and downsize your website. This feature may take up to several hours, depending on the number and size of existing images. 

On the https://ShortPixel.com website, we offer free access to the ShrtPixel API which you can use for further image optimisation purposes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens to the existing images, when installing the ShortPixel plugin? = 

Just installing the plugin won’t start the optimisation process on existing images. To begin optimising the images previously loaded on your website, you should:

* Go to **Media Library**, and select which of the existing images you want to optimise.

OR

* Use the **Bulk ShortPixel** option, to automatically optimise all your previous library.

= Should I pick lossy or lossless optimisation? =

This depends on your compression needs. **Lossy** has a better compression rate than lossless compression. The resulting image is not 100% identical with the original. Works well for photos taken with your camera.

With **lossless** compression, the shrunk image will be indistinguishable from the original, and smaller in size. Use this when you do not want to loose any of the original image's details. Works best for technical drawings, clip art and comics.

For more information about the difference read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression#Lossy_and_lossless_compression" target="_blank">Wiki article</a> on the lossy/lossless difference.

= Why do I need an API key? =

ShortPixel Image Optimiser uses automated processes to crunch images. The ShortPixel API integrates in the dashboard of your WordPress website and processes both old and new images automatically. You can also use the same API, multiple times, in your own applications, the <a href="https://shortpixel.com/api-docs">Documentation API</a> shows you how.

= Where do I get my API key? =

To get your API key, you must <a href="https://shortpixel.com/wp-apikey">Sign up to ShortPixel</a>. You will receive your personal API key in a confirmation email to the address you provided. Use your API key to activate ShortPixel plugin in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Where do I use my API key? =

You use the API key in the ShortPixel plugin Settings (don’t forget to click Save Settings). The same API key can be used on multiple websites/blogs. 

= How does Bulk Optimisation work? = 

The Bulk option makes ShortPixel optimise all your images at once (not one by one). You can do this in the Media > Bulk ShortPixel section by clicking on the **Compress all your images** button.

The batch optimisation may work slower, depending on your existing image gallery. Please be patient and do not close the Wordpress admin while you are rolling the Bulk Processing on your media gallery.

= Are my images safe? =

Yes, privacy is guaranteed. The ShortPixel encryption process doesn't allow anyone to view your photos.

= What happens with my original images after they have been processed with ShortPixel? =

Your images are automatically stored in a backup folder, on your hosting server. After optimisation, if you want to switch back to a certain original image, hit **Restore backup** in the Media Library. If you are happy with the ShortPixel optimised images, you can deactivate saving the backups in the plugin Settings.

= What types of formats can be optimised? =

For now, ShortPixel supports JPEG, PNG, PDF and GIF formats. Animated GIFs and thumbnails are also optimised. Additional formats are scheduled for optimisation in the future. 

= I’m stuck. What do I do? =
