		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I live a pretty charmed life. Happy childhood, awesome mom, decent jobs, great town and now of course, amazing girlfriend.

But last week’s events pushed ‘charmed’ into the realm of fairy tale in it’s abundance of random goodness that flowed through the day.
<!--more-->
Things started out pretty normal. Went to a doctor’s appointment, hauled my little bike to the shop for a tune up on the <a title="Bike on Bike love" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/2894031652/" target="_blank">big bike</a>.

On the way home, I had a sweet tooth and  went by the food cart pod on Mississippi to see if the Sugar Cube booth was open. It wasn’t. Sad panda! But I saw Jimmy with his table full of roasted nuts. I’d bought Jimmy’s nuts (try reading that without an inappropriate mental image, k? Thanks) once before and not only were they delicious, but I Jimmy was a true character. He was old(er), bearded, and gray and crazy nice.

“How you doing?” He asked.

“Not as good as I’d be if Sugar Cube was open.”

“Oh you need something sweet? Try this.” He scooped several samples into my hand. “Blackberry walnut, raspberry pecan and cinnamon almond.”

They were all as delicious as I remembered.

“Mmmm... those are great. I don’t have any cash though. Maybe I could have Jess stop by on her way home from work.”

He shoved a bag of raspberry pecans at me. “Just take the bag and come back later. It’s just a bag of nuts right? People need to trust each other more, that’s why I do that. That’s how we do it in the country.”

“Thanks!”

I pedaled home where I tried and failed to save Jess some of the nuts. Oops. Well I had to go back anyway.

A couple of hours later, the doorbell rang, three quick loud hits on the button: DING-DONG-DING-DONG-DING-DONG!

Clearly, it was someone invested in getting someone to the door quickly.  But it was far too aggressive a ring for a solicitor. That meant UPS or Fedex. Usually, they left our packages on the porch. It was quite possible that it was yet another REI purchase for Jess. But the doorbell was so authoritative. They must need a signature. That meant something valuable perhaps? A glimmer of possibility was sparked in my brain, but I kept calm and slowly, without hitting my knees on any chairs or the table, got up, made my way to the door and opened it.

Outside was a nice woman in a Fedex uniform, holding a small box. My hopes went up again. <em>Did he really...?</em> I saw the return address on the packing slip. My brain hovered somewhere between disbelief and ecstatic joy.

I signed for the box, took it inside, and opened it. Inside was this:

[caption id="attachment_16" align="aligncenter" width="225" caption="Whatchu talkin&#39; &#39;bout Willis?!?"]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ipad2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16" title="ipad" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ipad-225x300.jpg" alt="iPad" width="225" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

If you don’t follow me on Twitter (or even if you do), you might be wondering, why on earth would some guy don’t know, and never met, send me a $900 gift? (Yup, it’s 3G and 64 gig AKA top-o-the-line).

Well, we may never know the real reason, but it might be as simple as, he’s a really nice guy who wants to get his story told. In any case, here’s what I know.

A couple of weeks ago, my twitter stream filled up with tweets about Flipboard, an app for the iPad. Not owning an iPad and not planning to own one for some time unless I won the lottery, I ignored them. This is the same strategy I used before I got an iPhone, until Jess came to me one day and said, “I think it’s time for us to get iPhones," so then we went and looked at some and instantly fell for them and could talk of nothing else until we finally got some.

But folks seemed *<a href="http://twitter.com/tylersticka/status/19523578561" target="_blank">really</a>* excited about this app.  So I caved and went to the <a href="http://www.flipboard.com" target="_blank">website</a> to check it out.

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v2vpvEDS00o&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v2vpvEDS00o&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Then I sent out the following two tweets:

<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/blah-blah-flipboard-tweet.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20" title="blah blah flipboard tweet" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/blah-blah-flipboard-tweet-300x143.png" alt="blah blah flipboard tweet" width="300" height="143" /></a> <a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/maybe-someday-iPad-tweet.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-21" title="maybe someday iPad tweet" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/maybe-someday-iPad-tweet-300x141.png" alt="maybe someday iPad tweet" width="300" height="141" /></a>

Twenty-five minutes later, I received this reply from <a href="http://twitter.com/mmccue" target="_blank">@mmccue</a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://twitter.com/mmccue/status/19530537527"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24" title="no need to wait tweet" src="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/no-need-to-wait-tweet.png" alt="Free iPad tweet" width="584" height="304" /></a></p>
Reader, I thought the same thing you’d probably be thinking if you didn’t already know the end of this story. Is this guy serious?  Even with my charmed life and generally glass-half-full outlook, it doesn’t take a total <a href="http://www.winnie-pooh.org/eeyore-quotes.htm" target="_blank">Eeyore</a> to come up with a tragic ending to the girl who gave her address to some stranger on the Internet. But a free iPad would be pretty cool...

I checked out his Twitter stream and it was filled with messages to people about Flipboard and customer service replies. I checked out the website and there was an <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/press/update-from-flipboard-ceo-mike-mccue">update from CEO Mike McCue</a>. Either this guy was legit, or he was a serial killer with the most elaborate victim selection process ever. Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam’s razor</a>, I decided that the worst that could happen was nothing. I followed Mike, who assured me that he was serious, and gave him my address. Then I did my best not to think about it.

So here it was, three days later, and a shiny new iPad was sitting on my coffee table.

First, I texted a picture to Jess at work, who wasted no time claiming half of our new toy.

Next I hooked it up to my Mac and stuck all my phone apps on it (most of which I’ve since deleted since they look like crap on the iPad). Then of course, I downloaded Flipboard and put it on the front page. There was a wait list to be able to hook up my Twitter and Facebook feeds, but from the content that was already there, I could see it was elegantly made. (I'll have more to say about the app in a separate post).

I had somewhere to be in the afternoon, and still had to stop back by to pay Jimmy, and I now added to the list picking up a case for my new toy. The Internet seemed to agree that Marware had the best case for the iPad and I found one at the local Mac Store.

When I got back to Jimmy's, I said, "Jimmy, you're gonna love this." I took out the iPad. "A guy I don't know sent me this in the mail to today."

Jimmy didn't quite know what it was but his friend did. "It's six hundred dollars is what it is."

"Its a good day Jimmy. First nuts &amp; now a computer. By the way I need another bag, I didn't save any for Jess."

"Well every young lady needs a good pair of nuts," he said. I paid for both  bags (then, in my excitement, forgot to take the second one).

After I picked up my case from the Lloyd Center Mac Store, I was headed west on Multnomah to cross the bridge. A woman on a nice cruiser was behind me. There were cars backed up a few blocks from the steel bridge and a passenger opened his door into the bike lane just as we were coming down the hill.

"Nice," said cruiser woman.

"I know, I replied."

She asked if I was headed over the bridge. I said I was.

"Can you show me how to get over the top? I tried the other day and couldn't figure out where to get on." The bottom of the bridge had been closed for a few days for repair of one of the gate motors.

"Sure, just follow me," I said.

So I slowed my normal pace and made sure she got on to the narrow sidewalk. We had to skirt a few pedestrians on the way and then I bombed down the other side, and waited while she descended more cautiously.

"Wow, this is confusing. So where does this lead?"

"Where are you trying to go?"

"I'm headed to PSU. But I usually just take the Broadway bridge (which was closed for light rail construction) and it puts me right on the road."

"Broadway is right up here, just follow me and I'll tell you where to turn."

So I led her on and made sure she knew how to get back to the bridge when she was ready to go home.

My good mood went from 10 to 11. The sun was shining. The birds were singing. I had helped out a fellow cyclist. What could be better?

Things were so good in fact, that the thought crossed my mind that this wasn't going to last forever. It wasn't so much pessimism, as a warning to myself not to become depressed when life inevitably returned to normal.

After my meeting, I ran a few more errands which included (surprise!) stopping at REI to pick up an order for Jess. I successfully remembered to backtrack to Everett st towards the Steele bridge. A red light turned green just as I approached and I blew by two cyclists who were stopped. I noted with a quick glance that one had a pretty hefty bob trailer and the other had some hefty panniers with what was probably camping gear strapped over the top.

A few blocks later, I stopped to let some folks go through a cross walk. One of the bikers passed through while the people were crossing, not realizing why I had stopped in the middle of the road. The other one stopped behind me and said, "Sorry, we're not from around here."

"Where are you from?"

"I'm from Philly, he's from Jersey."

"You ride from there?"

"Yup."

We chatted some more, I found out their names were Sam and Mike and they met on the road the day before. Mike asked if I knew where a hostel was.

"Yeah, let's get up here to the bridge and I can give you directions."

So we kept going on Everett. Just as we approached the waterfront, the needle scratched rudely across the record of my bluebirds-singing-soundtrack.

A man surged past us, revving his engine. His car door was close enough I could have touched it, if he hadn't been moving so fast. He roared past us on the left and veered quickly back into the right lane...only to come to a stop at the red light half a block ahead.

I switched to the left lane and pulled up beside his open window.

"What's so important that you need to kill us?" I asked. In hindsight, I came up with all sorts of better things to say, but that's what came out.

"You bikers SUCK! .....MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.... ...PEDESTRIANS...."

I'm not sure if he was even making sentences at that point. Was he pissed because we stopped for pedestrians in a crosswalk? Would he have run them over? (I didn't doubt it). Clearly he was angry beyond any hope of reasoning. This wasn't going to be a fairy tale, <a href="http://bikeportland.org/2010/07/07/learning-from-a-road-rage-interaction/" target="_blank">let's realize we're all just people moment</a>. The light turned and he drove off in a screech of fury.

I turned to Mike and Sam. "Sorry, it's usually not *that* bad."

"Sounds like just another day in Philly," Mike said.

"Well, I've met too many awesome people today, so I'm letting that one roll off."

When we pulled into the waterfront, Sam's friend Henry was waiting.

<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mike_sam_henry_ontour.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22" title="mike_sam_henry_ontour" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mike_sam_henry_ontour-1024x768.jpg" alt="Mike, Sam &amp; Henry in the midst of a cross country bike tour" width="640" height="480" /></a>

Mike is photography and videographer, <a href="http://www.thewalk2010.com/" target="_blank">making a documentary of his travels</a>, while Henry and Sam are <a href="http://4walls4all.wordpress.com" target="_blank">riding and blogging</a> to raise money for <a href="http://www.4wallsintl.org/intro.shtml" target="_blank">4Walls4All</a>, a project to provide sustainable shelters to poor people.

My phone battery was dying rapidly, but I managed to look up a couple of hostel options for Mike and also map and give directions to Sam and Henry to get to their friend's house, which was (unfortunately for them) in the west hills. I suppose if they've been climbing mountain passes, then our little old hills probably didn't give them any trouble.  They were extremely grateful and offered me trail mix, then cash.

"Nope, I'm just passing it along today fella's." I gave them a brief run-down of my day, with show and tell. We traded URLs (like the kids do these days) and I wished them safe travels and rode off into the sunset.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Over the hills by ephany, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/4884102563/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4884102563_114e2dd8a0.jpg" alt="Over the hills" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Jess: Are you going to ride with me on Wednesday?

Me: Yes, but I don't want it to take all day.

I don't know what I was smoking, since that's the only kind of ride we do. But we are discovering lots of amazing new (to us) routes.

Yesterday we went over the west hills, down the back side of NW Thompson and out into the great suburban beyond.

<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bike_there_map.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-35" title="bike_there_map" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bike_there_map-300x225.jpg" alt="Map of the back side of NW Thompson" width="300" height="225" /></a>As we were riding along Laidlaw, a lovely little road with spotted with culdesac with important sounding names like 'Arbor Heights,' I said to Jess, "How come we've never come over here before? These roads are great!"

"Because we weren't willing to climb," she said.

Thank goodness for Cycle Oregon, which is forcing us to seek out hills so we'll be able to survive our vacation.

[caption id="attachment_36" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Just one reason why we don&#39;t ride with fast groups very often"]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/blackberries.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-36" title="blackberries" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/blackberries-300x225.jpg" alt="Ripe blackberries lined the path" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

We rode into the little town of Bethany, which I'd never heard of before yesterday, and onto the path in Springville Meadows Park. We rode along until a gust of wind overwhelmed us with the scent of ripe blackberries, at which time we pulled over to seek out the source and have a snack.

We followed the path to Rock Creek. Then just for variety, we followed quiet neighborhood street Rock Creek Blvd to 185th, crossed over highway 26, and looped back on Cornel Rd (nice wide bike lane) and 143rd Ave (non-existent shoulder :( ) before climbing back up Thompson.

Note to self: No more rides that end with coming back through town during rush hour on a weekday.

Just to top it all off with a cherry, we stopped by Metropolis Cycle Repair to pick up my newly tuned up Big Dummy. New chain(s) (it takes 4 or so to do the job), new cassette and I'm pretty sure the mechanic spit shined my frame with his own drool. I strapped the roadie on the back and pedaled home. Jess was kind enough to slow down and wait for me now that I was riding for two.

Such is the Portland bike scene that I barely got any comments or stares on the way home with my unwieldy load. Just as I was lamenting this fact to Jess, a guy called out from his truck, "Hey, you got a tow truck!"

Ah, there's the love.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning as I was riding to school, I was writing a Tumblr post in my head. A quick list of reasons I love bike commuting (especially in summer):
<ul>
	<li>The endorphins that come from moving</li>
	<li>scent of ripe blackberries on the wind at random places around the city</li>
	<li>checking out all the other bikes</li>
	<li>conversations about my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/sets/72157607063053194/" target="_blank">crazy dummy loads</a></li>
	<li>'fueling up' with Burgerville Walla Walla sweet onion rings and a blackberry shake</li>
</ul>
There are more, but you get the general theme. It was one of those mornings when life seemed pretty awesome and I was grateful to be enjoying it.

I arrived at the tutoring center at school and while I waited for my student I checked my email and learned that cancer <a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jessiesimmons" target="_blank">snatched away</a> another dear friend/wife/mother/daughter from us last night.

Jessie was a dear friend of my partner Jess (thankfully, she preferred to go by Jessie which minimized confusion :). Shortly after I met her and her husband Andy for the first time, Jessie was diagnosed with breast cancer. From her Caring Bridge blog:
<blockquote>In October 2006 I became a mama and was diagnosed with Stage IIb breast cancer. In August 2008 I learned that I have had a recurrence and am now Stage IV (stupid cancer).</blockquote>
With the necessity of juggling four busy schedules, I didn't get to spend much time with Jessie and her family over the last four years, but we were privileged to enjoy several lovely Shabbat dinners at their house, enjoy their company at a few of our winter waffle brunches and meet up for walks, coffee dates, bike rides at Sunday Parkways, park play dates, breakfast in the sun at a local waffle window or just quiet visits at home.

Through all this, Jessie battled her cancer with a combination of fierce determination to stick around for as long as possible coupled with a courageous acceptance of the unfortunate likely outcome. She blogged regularly (something I can't manage to do even with good health) on her Caring Bridge journal to keep all her fans and loved ones up to date, and usually began or ended each post with the reminder that "every day brings beauty, beauty in every day." It might be as simple as watching her son Sam get muddy in the park, or highlights from their recent family trip to Hawaii.

Whatever turmoil, despair or rage she experienced from her cancer, she always came back to gratitude and that is what she presented to the world.  Her willingness to accept her situation without denial is in stark contrast to my experience with my own family's impenetrable denial through my mom's cancer battle and it was admirable to watch.

I'm sad for myself, but mostly my heart goes out to Jess for the loss of her friend, Andy for the loss of his life partner, and Sam, who, at 3 years old, I hope will retain some memories of his mama that aren't just from vacation videos and pictures (though thankfully, there will be plenty of those for him to look at when he's older).

Cancer sucks and it's easy to feel powerless when it comes knocking on your door. But there are people out there that remind me that there are <a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com/2010/08/18/fight-cancer-win-an-intense-spider-2-with-2011-shimano-xtr-a-fox-fork/" target="_blank">things we can do to fight it</a>. Since my mom died, I've often thought about doing something more about fighting cancer, but full time school, house, partner, cats and other excuses have kept me from it.

But last fall, on a whim I joined Team Fatty just a week before the last Livestrong ride in Texas. I don't have Internet fame, thousands (or even tens) of blog hits or awesome prizes, but over just a few days, my awesome friends and family donated over $1000 to my Livestrong page.

This year, I have signed up for a ride I can do-- the <a href="http://www.echelongranfondo.org/index.html" target="_blank">Echelon Gran Fondo</a>, happening in just over a month in the Columbia Gorge. But that's only half the equation. The Gran Fondo is also a fundraiser to fight cancer, with money going to both the <a href="http://www.livestrong.org" target="_blank">Lance Armstrong Foundation</a> and more locally, to the <a href="http://www.echelongranfondo.org/beneficiaries.html#OHSUCancer" target="_blank">OHSU Knight Cancer Institute</a> (where Jessie started her treatments). Clearly it's time to stop procrastinating, and let you know that, if you hate cancer as much as we do, and you're of a mind to throw your pennies in the cancer fighting pot, you can <a href="http://echelon.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=337766&amp;lis=1&amp;kntae337766=A375BBF5C4954C3A906E33BED1530A27&amp;supId=287771987" target="_blank">donate on my ride page</a>.

I'll be riding in memory of my mom, Genia, my uncle Jonathan, our dear friend Jessie and in honor of our friends and family who have joined the ranks of cancer survivors (or are still in the fight).

I'm gonna do the thing I love, to fight the thing I hate. When I reach the top of the twenty-mile climb and enjoy the stunning view of Mt Hood, I am sure I will have no trouble finding the beauty in the day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were deep into winter when I began what I thought would be the process of getting Jess used to the idea of me running off to yet another mountain bike weekend without her.

"I'm thinking of doing the Dirt Series this summer," I said.

Then I had to explain what it was, send the website etc. Then a surprising thing happened.

"What if I want to go too?"

What? Was this the person who, when I called after my first day at Mountain Bike Oregon, raving about the awesome trails, said, "I like mountain biking--just not when it's really narrow, and there are trees really close to your bars, and drop-offs and obstacles."

"Honey, you don't like single track," I reminded her.

"Well, maybe if I was a better rider, I would like it."

"Um, you don't have a bike."

"If I get good, maybe I'll get a bike."

We left it at that.

But come spring, we were back at River City Bikes (AKA our third home--the second is REI), and next thing you know, I was making room for the eighth steed to enter our now very full garage.

She requested Mondays off for all of June and July, and joined me in racing the entire Short Track race series at PIR. In just a few weeks, I watched her confidence grow and saw her casually ride over, up and down features that would have had her walking not long before.

The Dirt Series fell the weekend before the last short track race. I had heard nothing but high praise from anyone who had been through the clinic and we were both excited about learning new skills.

Friday we had our usual late departure but an otherwise uneventful drive to Sisters, where we stopped for lunch and short ride on the Peterson Ridge trail to get our mountain legs.

We rode five miles up a forest service road, but the view was so lovely that I didn't even mind. After some climbing, we turned onto the trail.

It was typical eastern Oregon single track. Firm, sandy, fun, swoopy curves and only occasional sections with obstacles, mostly little rock gardens that I powered through and Jess walked.

There was some confusion about direction. Seems a few more trails have been added since I bought my map, but we didn't know that. It wasn't too big a deal, except that Jess was tiring quickly, had forgotten her inhaler, and I could tell she was ready to be done. We took a fork in the road that was probably the more technical of the two, which meant more hike-a-bike for her.

Eventually we got past all the hard stuff, and it was a nice cruise back to the park where we started. I had to slow way down, which was frustrating, but I reminded myself that after the weekend, Jess would hopefully have the skills to ride most of what we had just ridden (and of course remembering the inhaler will help too).

We cruised into Bend, where we had found lodgings with a stranger named Dan who had listed his spare room on AirBnB. It's not as sketchy as it sounds. He was out for the night when we arrived, but left a very thorough note and the dogs were sweet and didn't howl at us. The extra toothbrushes and guest book were a nice touch.

<strong>Saturday</strong>

We headed to Sunnyside Sports bike shop where there was the usual checking in, name tag acquisition, announcements etc. They were handing out armor to demo, and I picked up a set I had reserved in advance, and wished we'd gotten there earlier so Jess could have some too. Hers was reserved for Sunday and I just hoped she could keep herself whole without it until then. I wouldn't normally be so nervous about it, but during our first anniversary I learned that she can be somewhat fragile when practicing high risk activities.

The most important task of the morning was to found out which groups we'd been placed in. When you register for the clinic, they send quite lengthy questionaire about your skills, abilities, what you want to learn, and (cue forshadowing), if they feel you're on the cusp between skill groups, whether you'd rather be challenged in the harder group, or comfortable in the easier group. I picked A.

Jess got placed in the beginner-intermediate group, number four. Groups were rated 1-9 from easiest to hardest though the trainers seemed to want to keep that info close to the vest.

When I got to the head of the line, the trainer checked her lists and informed me that I was in beginner group number three.

THREE? BEGINNER? SERIOUSLY?

Three MBO weekends and two years of short track racing and she wanted to put me in beginner? ARE YOU $!*#*ing  KIDDING ME?

But what I said was, "Wow, beginner really? Are you sure about that? I consider myself to be pretty solidly intermediate."

'Yeah, it's beginner but it's a fit group. You'll like it."

And with that, it seemed, I had to be satisfied. For the moment. I spent the rest of the morning contemplating a world where I end up in a lower level mt bike skill group than Jess, who was walking over every obstacle the day before.

I put it aside, and finished getting ready, which involved changing over to flat pedals for the morning clinic. The website and all the instructors were very clear on this point. They pretty much insisted that everyone use flat pedals, at least in the morning skills clinics. Jess and I had both bought some cheap ones at REI for the occasion. When I tried them for the first time, I was surprised how grippy the mountain style pedals actually are, while still allowing you to bail at will. This is key for infusing more confidence into the attendees as we try new things.

In what seemed a hectic process, we eventually all herded over to Columbia park for morning skills. Fun obstacles were scattered around the park, including teeters, skinnies, drops and 'switchbacks' made with climbing rope.

My group started out with trainers Tracey and Pam for descending tips. We did some basic drills, learning the feel and limit of our brakes, i.e. how much pressure we can apply before they lock up. Then we learned the proper way to bail if the downhill going gets too hairy--off the back of the bike. Well, that was a revelation. Of COURSE you would want to step off in a way that lets the bike continue on while you are left standing unscathed on the trail. I saw immediately how this technique could have saved me from a silly endo on a loose switchback in Oakridge (and yet another set of knee scars....).

(insert about doing drops, while watching the other group do high speed drops)

After a couple of drills, Tracey and Pam pulled me aside.

"You look really solid on your bike."
"We don't think you should be here."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our house is never so clean as when we are about to leave it. Maybe someday we'll indulge in that kind of cleaning and then actually stay to enjoy it. But it is nice to come home to a clean house.

I'm typing this on my free Ipad (<a href="http://twitter.com/mmccue">Thanks Mike!</a>) as Jess drives us the last hour from Pendelten to Elgin, OR where tomorrow we will check in for our first Cycle Oregon. The packing process wasn't quite painless, but it was improved. I managed to fit a week's worth of essentials into a fairly small REI duffle. Jess's bag is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/4978447593/">little larger</a> but we're both 15-20 pounds under CO's stated 65 pound weight limit, which means we will be celebrated among the porters who will be schlepping our bags all week.

Getting our act together meant going to bed well before 3am (yay) but then today we reverted to type and left about 2 hours after our 'goal' time. The original plan was to get to Elgin in the early evening and check in. The new plan is to spend the night with our hosts and check in tomorrow with the rest of the masses.

Getting out of town was like trying to escape orbit. Gravity was completely against us. At the post office, Jess went in with a returns package (rejected jerseys and shorts from Team Estregen) to find one guy at the counter--with no less than 20 moving boxes to ship and one postal worker at the counter. We decided to drop the box back at home. Leaving again for our local food cart pod, we waited three minutes to turn left onto Lombard off of our street, only to end up behind a trimet bus.

But we finally managed to feed ourselves and get on the road, with remarkably little traffic getting out of town. I spent the first forty-five minutes going through my phone and making a new playlist, which brought me face to face with just how aged and hippy my music collection really is. The rules for the list were no Indigo Girls, Ani Difranco or Dar Williams.  Other than that, no genre was too obscure or random to pair together. Madanna nestled snuggly up against Paul Simon with an Aretha Franklin chaser. I limited myself to two show tunes out of kindness to Jess, who doesn't like musicals.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/4978430361/" title="Cycle Oregon Day -1 by ephany, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/4978430361_c981847769.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cycle Oregon Day -1" /></a>

Highway 84 has a well earned reputation as the most scenic highway in the country. Our drive has been a good preview of the kinds of scenery that await us during the next week of riding. Personally, I find the vista of hills covered in windmills to be stunning. My brain tried unsuccessfully to dredge up a few facts from my just-finished physics class about how windmills work, but it was a lost cause. They sure are impressiive though. Then it occurred to me that the sheer number of them doesn't bode too well for probable riding conditions. I'm sure I'll be on the lookout for a good wheel to suck.

Soon into the drive the road narrowed to one lane for construction. I got stuck behind a van pulling a trailer and was impatiently waiting for the road to widen when Jess said, "Look who it is."

I took a closer look. It was Augusto's Nossa Familia van. August is none other than the coffee savior of Cycle Oregon. He and his team will be rising at o'hell-no-thirty each morning to caffinate 2000+ cyclists. I heart him. I slowed and waited patiently and Jess waved as we passed him by.

Tomorrow we check in, pick up our wrist band and find our spot in tent city. Even though I haven't experienced it yet, let me just take a moment to sing the praises of tent and porter service. For the 300 or so folks who were quick enough on the draw, we will be able to roll into camp each night to find our tent set up for us and our bags waiting out front. No scouting for a spot or dragging our sub-65 pound bags to it.

BLISS

Because you know who would be setting up our tent after an 82 mile day with 15 miles of climbing? Go ahead, guess.

If you said me, give yourself two points! Thank you tent and porter service, for making this truly a vacation for both of us.

Saturday is known as 'Day 0' because it's the day we check in and then just hang out meeting people and exploring Elgin. Today I had the grand idea that introductions should all be conducted thusly:

"Hi, I'm NAME from CITY and this is my NUMBER Cycle Oregon." Then we can get right to the good stuff. I'm going to work on making that a trend, starting tomorrow.

It's 9:27 and we're about 15 miles from Elgin. Only four hours later than we 'planned.' I'm cool with it. Our last night in a bed before we start our adventure.

This has been a test of the mobile blogcast system. Thanks for tuning in. See you on the road.]]></content:encoded>

I tip my cycling cap to those who ride fast enough to get into camp early and have energy to hang out in the beer garden and dance to the band. Maybe next time...]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>What Can We Do Against Cancer in 3 Days? - UPDATED</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Well it turns out we can do a lot. We made the $500 mark on Wed and to date have raised $611 dollars in the fight against cancer. Thank you so much for your help! I'll have a report on the ride very soon, and news about the winners of my two prize drawings.</strong>

The <a href="http://www.echelongranfondo.org/portland/index.html" target="_blank">Echelon Gran Fondo</a> is approaching at approximately the speed of light (sun going around the earth at least).  In fact it is THIS SUNDAY, the 26th! ::Kermit Flail:: Thanks to a long summer of training and a week of tough but fun days on Cycle Oregon last week, my legs are totally ready for the 100 mile course and the 20 mile climb in the middle.

But there's another area where I've been sadly lacking, and that is arguably the most important part of the ride: raising money to fight cancer. The Gran Fondo is a benefit for both the Lance Armstrong Foundation and the Knight Cancer Center at OHSU.

Last year around this time, I got a wild hair and signed up on the Livestrong team for a ride I couldn't actually do, but I was just in a <a href="http://ephany.blogspot.com/2009/10/fight-cancer-win-ipod-touch.html">cancer-fighting mood</a>. You, my awesome friends and family, donated over $1000 <strong>over a weekend</strong>. So I know it's not too late for us to do some good together, even though the fund raising deadline is only three days away.

<a href="http://echelon.kintera.org/gorge/kronda" target="_blank">My donation page is right here, if you've heard enough and you're ready to give.</a>

I don't have an iPod to give away this time, but just to sweeten the pot a little, I do have a couple of fun things to raffle off. If you're a <a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com" target="_blank">Fat Cyclist</a> reader, you'll know this drill well. Every $5 you donate gets you one chance to win a prize.
<h3>Prize the First (Locals Only--really local)</h3>
Most anyone who knows me, knows how much I love my Big Dumb Bike AKA the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/2819943422/in/set-72157607063053194/" target="_blank">Big Dummy</a>. I use it to carry anything from my little Timbuk2 bag, to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/sets/72157607063053194/detail/" target="_blank">ridiculous loads of stuff </a>up to and including my other bikes. And sometimes I use it to carry my girlfriend Jessica.

[caption id="attachment_67" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Jess on the Snow Dummy"]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jess-on-snow-dummy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-67" title="jess on snow dummy" src="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jess-on-snow-dummy.jpg" alt="Jess ready to get hauled" width="500" height="375" /></a>[/caption]

So, for some lucky contributor who is also local*, I'm offering up Dinner By Dummy. I will pick you up on the back of my cool bike, and take you out to dinner at the dining establishment of your choice** and deliver you back home full and happy. You may invite whoever you wish to come along, but only ONE winner will get to ride on the Dummy.
<h3>Prize the Second (on one condition)</h3>
Many of you know that I'm also what I refer to as Geek in Training, about to start my last year (yay!) of school in the Web Design and Interactive Media program at the Art Institute of Portland. Prize the second is 10 hours of free web development work and/or training from yours truly (a $400 value). I leave this description pretty broad because the range of folks who might win this will vary. Things you might request include:
<ul>
	<li>Help setting up that blog you've been meaning to start on Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr or other platform of your choice</li>
	<li>Help picking a new theme and customizing your already existing blog</li>
	<li>Build a simple website (probably template based) for your small business or personal use</li>
	<li>Getting your digital photos up online where people can actually see them</li>
	<li>Edits to your existing website or learn how to do it yourself</li>
</ul>
Those are just a few ideas that come to mind. I'm flexible and want the winner to get the most out of our time together. You don't have to be local to win this prize and you don't have to need a website. If there's something geeky I know how to do and you don't, I'll help you out.

Since this is a pretty big time commitment for someone about to start her last year of school, prize the second has one condition: <strong>We have to break the $500 mark in total funds raised by Friday September 24th. </strong>

I have absolutely no doubt that we can accomplish this goal because our army is large and mighty. If everyone who reads this gives $5, we will triple that goal easily.

Ready to donate yet? <a href="http://echelon.kintera.org/gorge/kronda">Get going! </a>
<h3>No Cash? No Problem!</h3>
If you're short on cash, but long on a useful skill (Massage? Anyone? Anyone?)  and you'd like to add to my little raffle prize pot, please leave a comment and I'll update this post.
<h3>Why Should You Do This?</h3>
If you don't have an extremely personal reason to hate cancer yet, it's a sad fact that you will probably have one in your lifetime.  Here are just a few of the reasons I'm riding:

<h4>Thanks for reading, <a href="http://echelon.kintera.org/gorge/kronda" target="_blank">donating</a> and spreading the word.</h4>
<h4>The Fine Print (Prize the First)</h4>
*Local in this case means within 10 miles of my house, unless you're willing get yourself to my house as the starting point.

** Restaurant has to be withing a five mile radius of the starting point (my house or yours)

*** Weight limit for passengers is 200 lbs (and probably all I could pedal anyway)

****This prize is 'weather permitting' <em>as decided on by the winner</em>. I have the gear to ride in pretty much any weather!]]></content:encoded>

Gran Fondo is Italian for 'big ride' which this certainly was, with <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/125930/" target="_blank">more than 8300 feet of elevation gain</a> and a 20 mile timed hill climb at mile 45. The Gran Fondo falls into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclosportive" target="_blank">weird space somewhere between a race and a ride</a>. In order to finish before the course closed, I would need to ride the fastest century of my life. But with a summer of training and Cycle Oregon behind me, I felt up to it.
<h3>The Last 4am Wake Up Call</h3>
Start time was at 8:30am in Hood River, an hour's drive from home. I was up and out of the house by 5:37am, only seven minutes later than my goal time. Those of you who know me, know what a miracle this is. As I turned the corner off of my street, I had to pause for a guy walking across the street. As I turned, I noticed that he and another guy were loading bikes onto a truck. I almost rolled down the window and asked if they were headed to Hood River. I mean, where else would you be going at 5am in September with your bike? I wanted to keep this 'on time' thing going though so I just continued on and hit the highway.

It's dark for a long time in the mornings now, and yesterday's clear skies were a just a happy memory beneath the clouds that darkened the pre-dawn sky. So I was surprised and elated when, about halfway to my destination, I got to witness an amazing fiery pink glow between the clouds in the distance. Sunrise is something I don't get to enjoy very often and I savored every moment.

[caption id="attachment_101" align="alignright" width="177" caption="The closest I will get to Horner all day"]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010_0926_002_gran_fondo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-101" title="2010 Echelon Gran Fondo" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010_0926_002_gran_fondo-177x300.jpg" alt="me and Chris Horner" width="177" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

After being misdirected and then redirected, I found my way to the start and was dressed and ready to go by 7:30am. Another miracle. The ride update had said that announcements and call-ups would start at that time, but there was not much going on that I could see so I enjoyed some free juice and snacks from the tent. I saw Chris Horner, the celebrity guest rider from the Radio Shack team (and 10 place finisher of the Tour de France this year) so I went over and got my picture with him. Chris seemed as nice as everyone always says he is.

In the sea of gathering riders I spot another Black woman. She's short and stout--the opposite of most of the racer types milling around the start--and she's riding a very expensive Cervelo. I love it but I before I get all excited about finding one of 'my people' I remind myself that the chance of her being from Portland is about .00003%. Her name is Deanna and she's from Seattle. I introduce myself and wish her good luck on the 60 mile route.

People started to gather seriously at the start around 8:10. After a last minute decision to wear my leg warmers after all, I made my way into the crowd, saying hi to teammates Judy, Linda and Lynn on the way. Judy wistfully asked if I had brought my big bike and wanted to carry her around the course. Ha. She can ride circles around me any day and should probably have been pulling *me* on the course.

The announcer did call ups to recognize top fund raisers, denoted by jersey colors, and also invited any cancer survivors, denoted by a yellow bib number, to the front. Though I had good intentions of starting my fund raising earlier and shooting higher, I have to admit that the blue jersey for $500 fundraisers fits nicely with my bike and general color scheme. Rider #1, wearing a yellow number, made her way past me. She looked to be about in her early 40's and slightly on the heavy side. The 100 miles was going to be a big challenge and I wished her good luck.

When the announcer introduced Chris Horner, he was nowhere to be found. "He's probably enjoying the coffee and will catch up with you guys." Goodness knows we could use the head start...

Lastly Hunter Zeising, one of the main organizers, said a few words. He asked that the group 'roll out easy' for the first 12-15 miles to Rowena Crest and said that videographers would be filming the peleton coming down off the Crest. "I really want to keep the cancer survivors on the front for the first few miles, so if you see someone who needs a hand up the hill, give them a push."

We were supposed to also have a military fly over, but no planes were in evidence. A local Hood River girl did a great job singing the national anthem, and then we were officially underway.
<h3>Away At Last</h3>
I knew immediately that I should have done more stretching and warm up before the ride. I was thinking, 'oh, slow roll out, I can warm up in the first few miles.' No such luck. We almost immediately started doing some fairly steep climbing, and my hamstrings were NOT HAPPY with developments. Since I had been called up near the front, scores of hardcore racer dudes zipped pass me as we climbed. It seemed that some peoples version of 'roll out slow' translates to hammer as hard as possible to get off the front.

The planes showed up about a mile into the ride, and flew over us as we gained elevation and cruised into the Mosier Tunnels.

I caught up to a woman with a yellow number riding one of the drool-worthy wooden Renovo bikes (yes, really they're made of wood). I asked how long she'd had it and if she loved it. "It's beyond love," she said. "It really got me through the last year and a half." When I mentioned seeing a couple of Renovo's on Cycle Oregon, she replied, "Yup, one of them was mine. I talked to you in Waitsburg, I'm <a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jessiesimmons" target="_blank">Jessie's</a> friend Laurie."

Serendipity! Laurie has had a more fortunate outcome of her breast cancer and was on the 100 mile ride as well. I wished her luck and rode on.

[caption id="attachment_102" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="View from Rowena Crest"]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010_0926_019_gran_fondo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102" title="2010 Echelon Gran Fondo" src="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010_0926_019_gran_fondo.jpg" alt="View from Rowena Crest" width="500" height="375" /></a>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: center;">The climb to Rowena Crest was stunning. The Columbia river stretched off into the distance and the clouds were just thick enough to provide interesting patterns to the sky and keep the temperature perfect for climbing. I kept my rest stop lingering to a minimum at the top of the crest but did stop to get a picture.</p>
Jess and I had ridden the Mosier Tunnels/Rowena Crest to The Dalles part of the route a few years ago on the Gorge Ride. On that occasion, 30-40 mile per hour wind gusts kept us pretty timid on the descent. The wind was kinder this time and, with no one around me (most sensible folks turned back at Rowena crest for the 30 mile route), I bombed down the hill with only the slightest touches on my brakes. At one point, a motorcycle came by headed uphill with a cameraman with a very big video camera on the back so I tried to look cool. Maybe I'll make the YouTube video.

Down on Hwy 30 I started thinking how nice it would've been to have a team to ride with, as there is not much to think about on those long straight stretches besides the wind. The wind was actually not terrible considering that Hood River is the windsurfing capital of the world. But 100 miles is a long way, and I still had pipe dreams of making it to Dufur in time for some of the hype and pageantry of the hill climb time trail mass start. Those dreams died as the reality of my average speed (14-15mph) stared up at me from my bike computer.

A guy wearing #477 passed me by at a good but not blistering clip and without a second thought, I grabbed his wheel, which brought my speed up to the 19-20 range. We cruised along until the split for the 100 and 60 mile routes, when I lost him at the turn.

I was alone again for a while, but saw three women up ahead as I headed through an industrial looking section of The Dalles. I caught them eventually and asked if I could join them for a while. As we chatted and rode, I realized two things. 1) They were riding slower than I could on my own and 2) They either didn't have any idea how, or didn't care to ride in any kind of pace line. When a couple of Trader Joes riders and friends cruised by on the bike path, I jumped ship and latched on. But another rest stop halted that train just moments later.

Rest stops were generally stocked with Costco trail mixes, bagels &amp; cream cheese, almonds, Ruffles potato chips, water, electrolyte drink and fruit. For 100 mile ride of this level, I thought the food was a little lacking, save for the Hammer guys who were giving out flasks of Hammer gel at this particular stop, 26 miles in. Luckily, Jess and I have a policy of never depending completely on 'supported' rides and I had stuffed my pockets full with my own flask of Hammer products plus various standard bike food consisting of gels or blocks. I took an extra flask of Tropical flavored Hammer gel just in case.

We headed further east toward Dufur via Eight Mile road and 15 Mile road. I had stood shivering on 8 Mile road two years ago while volunteering for the Cherry Blossom Classic road race that our team co-sponsors. It was a lot more fun to ride on it in nice weather. I felt small and sheltered, riding in the crevice between large hills with the occasional country house and barn and maybe three cars passed the entire time I was on the road. I was alone for most of this time but would occasionally see riders further up the road and was  able to catch and pass most of them. I thought of them as my carrots, and one guy was even wearing an orange jersey.

My friendly wheel from earlier in the day, #477 passed me again. Given  the speed with which he had left me behind earlier, he must have  lingered quite a bit at the rest stop. I latched on again and this time  we had an amiable chat. He and his girlfriend had driven up from  Oakland, CA to do the ride, as a preparation for an even harder century  coming up. His instructions were to wait for her at each rest stop.

[caption id="attachment_103" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Lonely road"]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010_0926_026_gran_fondo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-103" title="2010 Echelon Gran Fondo" src="http://kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2010_0926_026_gran_fondo-300x225.jpg" alt="Hwy 197" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

We turned onto Hwy 197 which was smooth with a nice wide shoulder, but hillier. #477 went on his way. It was near 11:30 and I was still at least 10 miles from Dufur with the road pointing up. The racers would be massing for the start of the time trial. I let go of my earlier goal and focused on enjoying the amazing country I was lucky enough to be riding through and thinking about the cancer victims and survivors I was honoring with this ride.

Two of my carrots from 8 mile caught up to me on the hwy. One of them, a woman named Allie asked as she drew even with me, "Did you have a white jacket? I experienced simultaneous panic and overwhelming relief as I realized that my brand new Sugoi shell from Cycle Oregon must have fallen out of my pocket earlier, and that she was even as I responded, pulling it out to hand it back to me. I thanked her profusely and followed it up by pulling her back up to her friend who had gone on ahead of us. Then I pulled them both the rest of the way to Dufur.
<h3>The Hill</h3>
The rest stop was quiet with about 20 people resting in the grass. The snack table held much the same items as the last stop and they had run out of water. I heard a volunteer send someone for more water. In the meantime, they set up a hose. I filled both my bottles and had some peanut butter on a slice of bread, then got very attached to the salty goodness of the Ruffles.

My plan was not to linger to long at any of the rest stops, since that is what always eats up the most time on our normal recreation rides. But 45 miles is a long 'warm up' for a 20 mile hill climb and there was a lot of climbing to get to the climb. So I hung out, ate chips, stretched and made two trips to the blue rooms while promising myself I will not do any more activities that require using a porta-potty until at least summer of 2011.

Finally, I had no more excuses and time was marching on. Pulling myself away from the Ruffles was hard. My Trader Joes buddies from earlier had left a while ago. Rider #1 showed up and was looking good.

There was no one close by to ask, so I didn't get a picture of myself under the time trial start banner. My leave taking was quiet and without fanfare. I noted the time, 12:50pm. In a few blocks I was through the town of Dufur and back into the country side. Fortunately the road didn't actually turn up for a couple of miles so I was able to get back into a rhythm. I made a right turn onto  Dufur Valley Rd.

Soon enough, the climbing began in earnest.

I had a couple of rules for myself for this challenge.
<ol>
	<li>No stopping. This was a time trial and besides that, I'm stubborn. I would ride in the style of my first Larch Mountain ascent and go until it was done or I fell into a ditch by the side of the road. I had three generations of stubbornness to draw from so I was pretty sure I'd make it.</li>
	<li>No watching the mileage. That's just depressing. I adopted a tactic that worked well on Cycle Oregon: Set my cycle computer to the time and estimate my arrival based on my average speed.</li>
</ol>
My rather ambitious goal was to average 10mph over the climb and finish in close to two hours. My early speeds weren't terribly encouraging but I kept at it. The first few miles were the worst, as my legs resisted accepting the new reality of the next couple of hours.

In order to focus on something besides the pain I thought about my mom, my uncle Jonathan, and Jessie. My mom would have thought I was crazy, but also been really proud and bragging to anyone who would listen. Uncle Jonathan was a massive man with biceps the size of my quads. Whenever I saw him, he would squeeze muscles and ask if I was still lifting weights. Jessie would have appreciated the beauty of the day. I wasn't too far from the Pacific Crest Trail which she and her husband Andy quit their jobs to hike from end to end. She knew a lot about challenges and big adventures.

I imagined them all pushing me up the hill and it really helped.

I feasted on a steady diet of shot blocks, gels, water and carrots. Only the carrots were metaphorical. Early on I was passed by a racer-type in a Livestrong jersey who blew by at about twice my speed, never to be seen again. I began to think that I wouldn't see anyone else during the entire climb, but after a while, little dots in the distance resolved into other cyclists that I would eventually catch and pass.

I passed two guys sitting by the side of the road. "Are you guys OK?" I asked as I slowly pedaled by.

"Yes, we're just waiting for divine inspiration," one of them joked. Or maybe he wasn't kidding. Me and my ghosts moved on.

During my two+ hours on the climb I saw exactly two support cars associated with the ride. It was a far cry from the luxurious cradling of Cycle Oregon. I at least had the comfort of knowing their were still riders behind me in case I did end up in that ditch.

The carrots started coming faster. First one or two, then four at a time. At one point I caught myself thinking I might run out of road before I caught someone. That's when I knew I had officially crossed the sanity barrier. (Some of you may think it was much sooner--like signing up for this torture in the first place :). I passed people walking their bikes and resisted the urge to tell them <a href="http://axoplasm.com/content/don%E2%80%99t-walk-your-bike-hill" target="_blank">why they shouldn't walk their bikes up the hill.</a>

I crossed into the Mt Hood National forest, and the road got blissfully smoother. I swear chip seal takes a mile per hour off my speed. The road eased up and even dipped once or twice but other than that, it was pretty unrelenting. Another team mate reported grades as high as 12% from her Garmin computer. I'm really glad I didn't know that at the time.

When I felt like resting, I did it by dropping into my granny gear and cruising along at 4mph. These were also good times to grab another gel pack and eat it. On one occasion, one of my carrots passed me back. I caught her again when I was done eating and as I went by, she asked, "Do you know that your right knee collapses in?"

"Yup."

"Oh OK. I could see that it gets worse when you're tired."

"Yup."

I wasn't mad about this. My right knee does collapse and I'm sure riding along at 4mph trying to open a gel without falling over, it was particularly bad. And I understand the urge to help other riders with obvious bad habits. I saw riders with bikes that were painfully too small for them, riders with bow-legged pedal strokes and worse.  I generally resist saying anything, since most people don't appreciate unsolicited advice.

I did make an effort to straighten out my stroke though. Me and my wobbly knee passed Betty back and made it stick.

I was pretty sure I was getting close to the top. I saw a sign that said Dufur was 17 miles behind me and the climb was only 20 miles. It was eerily quiet though, which I thought was strange, since the organizers had promised
<blockquote>...a TDF like hill top finish with some                      great food...Borat and a whole cast of characters will be there to greet                      you along with some live music at the summit. Stop, have                      some gelato before you continue downward on a nostalgic                      mountain highway for over 35 mile descent through alpine                      roads to the town of Hood River.</blockquote>
I didn't hear any festive sounds or see any characters on the road. What I did hear was the slow rumble of a large truck approaching from behind. When it pulled up beside me, I saw a rider in the passengers seat, with his window down. "Free ride to the top?" he asked.

We were less than two miles from the top. I was annoyed. "That's cruel," I said. "No way." The van rumbled on and once past me, I saw about a dozen riders hanging out in the back with their bikes. I wish I had taken a photo, but I was too focused on turning over the pedals. I watched as they pulled up to the next rider. At least one more took the offer, but most didn't. As I passed them, I congratulated them on resisting temptation.

Less than five minutes later. I spotted an OBRA tent at the side of the road and two tiny orange cones graced either side of the traffic lane.  I passed through them without fanfare. I had expected to feel some sense of triumph and I suppose I did, but mostly the whole thing seemed anticlimactic. A few feet down the hill, the SAG truck was parked in the lane, letting riders out at the rest stop.

The food turned out to be much the same as the previous rest stop, but they did have Cup'o'Noodles soups and Chad, the race organizer for the Cherry Blossom Classic, was heating up water for hungry riders. I was irrationally happy to meet up with another bag of Ruffles and spent some quality time with it, but didn't really eat much else. There were Oreos but I wasn't in the mood for sweet.

I saw #1 again, who had taken a ride up in the van and was determined to ride the rest of the course.
<h3>Down Down (Up) Down</h3>
The clouds had gone from shady and pretty to grim and ominous at that elevation and I never did get a view of Mt Hood. I had left my arm and leg warmers at the gear drop in Dufur and just kept my wind shell. Looking at the clouds and the mist that was starting to swirl around, I knew I had a cold descent ahead of me.

I pulled my jacket on and set out. The road was back to chip seal and the rain came down harder as I descended. Wind gusts added to my stress. A car pulled up behind me and waited respectfully to pass, but the road was windy and narrow and there were no safe places so I finally pulled over. I was relieved to see bikes in a rack on top when they went by.

I concluded that this descent was the opposite of fun and I would be glad when it was over. Had the van come up to me at that point, I would have gladly taken a ride to the bottom. Fortunately in 15 minutes or so, I lost enough elevation that the temperature warmed up considerably. I also turned on to Hwy 35 so the road smoothed out again. I started to really fly and enjoy myself.  I passed Cooper's Spur resort and thought to myself, <em>I can't believe I'm riding my bike on the road we take to go skiing in the winter</em>.

As we I dropped into the outskirts of Hood River, the road went back to chip seal, the worst I had ridden yet. A guy I had been leap-frogging with on the descent and had been on my wheel offered to 'push the wind' for a while when I slowed down.

His choice of words were a red flag that I was probably not dealing with a very experienced drafter. I accepted his offer somewhat dubiously. Sure enough, not a minute passed before he stopped pedaling and stood up to coast and stretch his back with zero verbal warning and me three feet off his wheel. Not steady didn't begin to cover it. But we were making great time over the awful chip seal so I stayed with him for a while.

We pulled up to a rider in a green jersey, who was going considerably slower. My wind-pusher slowed down and dropped in behind him and started braking erratically and looking back to see if it was safe to pass. "All clear," I said, but he didn't move for over a mile. Then, with a truck bearing down on us, he decided *that* would be a good time to pass.

After that I decided slow was better than dead. I made the excuse of pulling over to shed some layers, which I really did need to do. I was quite happy to crawl along at 9mph on my own. Soon I caught up to a couple I had also seen a lot on the Hwy 35 descent. I had followed them for a few minutes, but her wheel was even worse than wind-pusher so I let them go. Now they were hugging the white line that marked the edge of the car lane, even though we had at least six feet of shoulder. They continued on this path even one semi truck and then another came roaring by only two feet from them. Later when we finally turned off the highway, I heard her remark to her friend, "Man I thought that semi was going to take you out!"

The stupidity of people never ceases to amaze me.

I left them behind and the roads became quiet and car-free with only the massive orchards I was riding through for company. I was fine with that. Trees bowed over with pears of different types and colors, so close to the road I could just about reach out and pluck one as I passed.  I was really temped.
<h3>All's Well That Ends</h3>
It was close to 5pm and I was pretty sure I could make the finish before 5:30. The course closed at 6:00.  For being 95 miles into the hardest ride I'd ever done, I felt pretty good, but I was definitely ready to be finished. The big windy curves we had traveled up that morning made a lovely finishing descent into downtown Hood River. A few blocks up hill and a turn and the finish was in sight. A few folks were sitting at the last turn and cheered me in. There was no one around me but the big clock ticking off the time inspired me to sprint for the banner as the announcer called out my finish, and even pronounced my name right. That was nice.

Teammate Judy was at the finish, helping to break down a tent. "Nice job Kronda!" she congratulated as I came in. I thanked her and headed straight to the car to change. As I was taking the camera out of my bike bag, I realized I really should get a finishing photo. It was painful to put my helmet and gloves back on but I went back and Judy did the honors. The announcer even called me out again.

Then I got out of my things and headed to the dinner tent, starving.

The party was long over. Tents were being broken down all over the parking lot. There were still quite a few riders in the dining area, enjoying the FREE BEER that seems to excite 99.9% of cyclists. There was also a local winery represented.

To say I was disappointed with my findings at the food table would be understating things. It was clear that there had at once time been a lot of good food offered, but what was left was pretty much the dregs of that offering. I got the last taco shell from the taco bar, but the chicken was long gone so I made do with beans, iceberg lettuce and cheese that I shouldn't have been eating (lactose intolerance). There were also a few cold wraps left--hummus or chicken ceasar. I snagged a chicken wrap and found a table with as few other people as possible. I was tired, hungry and pissed off. The number one rule of a supported ride is YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF FOOD OR WATER and the Eschelon organizers, after all the hype about how 'spoiled' we would be on the ride, hadn't managed to to follow either of those simple requirements.

As I listened to the riders at my table chat about the day, I got the sense that people experienced very different rides depending on where they were in the peloton. One guy spoke of riding Chris Horner's wheel for five miles and enjoying and easy 27mph cruise at the end of a long team pace line. A woman told how she barely made it through the climb after running out of water halfway up, even though she filled both her bottles at the Dufur rest stop (there was no water available between Dufur and the top of the twenty mile climb). Another guy didn't even get water in Dufur because the hose wasn't hooked up when he was there.

#1 showed up about forty-five minutes after I arrived. She was exhausted and there was even less food left. I felt terrible for her but I heard her tell her husband, "I don't want any of this crap food, get me to a restaurant." Who knows if she would have felt that way had their been a decent amount of food to choose from.

I ate quickly and headed back to Portland, scheming the whole way about what I could pick up on the way home for my second dinner. I finally settled on pasta to go from Pastini. By the time I ordered, the one bench for people waiting for a table was full with a party of four. I was sorely tempted to tell them I'd ridden my bike 100 miles to fight cancer and ask if any of them would like to give up their seat? But I didn't. I sat on the floor instead and stretched a little.

Food came and there was just one gas station stop between me and getting home to my take out, my girlfriend and a warm shower. So when the gas station attendant randomly asked if I knew how to get to Skyline Blvd, I felt a bit like the Universe was plotting against me. But I got out and went over to a young white guy driving an enormous pick up truck who wanted to take his girlfriend for a drive in the hills. He seemed nice enough. I gave him directions, and only when I was walking (legs were not happy about this) back to the car, did it occur to me that I could have had him walk over to me. I think I inherit this automatic impulse to help everyone from my mom.

I made it home at 8:30, sixteen and a half  hours after waking that morning, after four hours of sleep. The next day I realized in my tired state, I had forgotten to pick up my arm and leg warmers from gear drop. As soon as I crossed the finish line, I just about ran into the guy holding up a huge sign that said TIMING CHIP RETURN. They were pretty adamant about getting each one of those $100 chips back. It would have been great if they showed equal concern for tired riders by having someone remind people to pick up their gear.
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
Am I glad I did this ride? Absolutely. I knew the challenge I was getting into and I met all my goals, both for fund raising and completing the ride. My official finish time for the century is 8:35:46. My time for the hill climb was 2:11:51 (206/333 timed). The cause was a great one, the scenery was amazing and I enjoyed most of the route.

Would I do it again? Not likely, at least not until EGF has a few years to get their act together. As reports come in from other (faster) riders, I realize that if you are a racer, you probably had a good time on this ride. For the rest of us, EGF completely failed to deliver the experience they advertised:
<blockquote>We are going to provide every rider the experience of riding                      in a European Gran Fondo or pro race including the food, the                      on course support, and the after party. You will experience                      the same if it takes you 4 hours to finish or if it takes                      you all day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Whether you are riding to win in your category or just                      trying to hit a new PR, there is an exciting challenge for                      everyone, not to mention a great experience on some of the                      most scenic rides in the country. Racers - yes, Spandex -                      yes, Tri Geeks - yes, Weekend Warriors - yes.

We have added in timing and the pageantry of the Tour de                       France including partial road closure, police motorcades. We                       also add in a competitive element by providing every  rider                      an electronic chip to track your time. Ride  it or race it,                      Echelon will be a blast.

Regardless if you fundraise for our cancer constituents,                      this event is also about you. Stick around for a great party                      when the ride ends.</blockquote>
Reports from folks who finished in 5-6 hours  highlight the discrepencies even more:
<blockquote>Within a mile of the summit...I  saw an angel, sasquash, the devil who was fishing for riders with a  twinkie, two hunters (who weren't with the race, btw) and Elvis...</blockquote>
<blockquote>We finished up the ride (and were welcomed back with all the Hammer  products you could ever want - Heed, Recoverite, etc as soon as you got  off your bike). There was a big food tent and a band playing. I ate my  pizza, chicken caesar wrap and a beer sitting next to Elvis, Sasquatch  and the Devil watching the band and chatted with fellow bikers and  Sorellas until it was time to head home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The meal at the end was one of the best I've ever had on an organized  ride: chicken wraps, beet salad, mini burgers, tacos with black beans,  rice, chicken, fresh guac.and salsa, mixed green salad, lasagna, fruit,  snacks and mini cakes for dessert! Oh, and wine, beer and sodas!</blockquote>
I wish I and all the people who finished after me could have enjoyed that ride too. The survey sent out to riders the next day only allows a total of 850 characters for comments/suggestions. Hardly enough to address all the massive deficiencies in their ride support. Perhaps the folks at EGF should talk to<a href="http://www.goodsportpromotion.com/good_sport_about.html" target="_blank"> Good Sport Promotion</a> or <a href="http://www.cycleoregon.com/" target="_blank">Cycle Oregon</a> about what good ride support looks like for ALL riders and how to make it happen.

I applaud them for their goal of helping worthy charities, but they have a lot to learn about supporting all the participants. Next year, maybe I'll set my sights on the <a href="http://www.livestrong.org/Take-Action/Team-LIVESTRONG-Events/LIVESTRONG-Challenge-Series/LIVESTRONG-Challenge-Seattle" target="_blank">Seattle Livestrong Challenge</a>. I hear they've got some good hills up there.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi there, great blog and excellent writing.  Just happened upon your blog looking for something else completely.  I volunteered to work this ride and have some inside perspective.  In trying to donate as large an amount as possible to the beneficiaries of his ride, they hired as few paid staff as possible and everyone got overloaded with jobs.  I can tell you that I know for sure that they learned their lessons and are very sorry.  Echelon is hiring many new staff and specifically to manage on course and after the ride food and beverages.  If you give us a chance in 2011, I believe you will see that their first year was a learning experience and year two will be soooo much better on many levels!  If you loved the route and you want to give to the charity you might give 2011 a shot.  The new food and expo people are very experienced.  Thanks for your great report.  Huge apologies for not spoiling you like you should have been.  Thanks for participating either way.  (o:

I hope you win one of the FREE Wilier bikes they are giving away just for tracking their 2011 events.  You deserve it!!

		<title>How to Get an Internship</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_125" align="aligncenter" width="630" caption="Procrastination is the enemy."]<a href="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/internship_howto1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-125" title="internship_howto" src="http://dev.kronda.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/internship_howto1.jpg" alt="6 steps to obtaining your academic internship" width="630" height="265" /></a>[/caption]

I started my academic internship at <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com" target="_blank">Metal Toad Media</a> this week. I had originally planned to do my internship this summer, while I was only taking two classes. Then I remembered how bitter I was going to school full time last summer so I wasn't too upset when the couple of leads I was following didn't pan out.

I rode my bike instead and had an awesome summer. I returned home from Cycle Oregon and a couple of weeks before school started, it occurred to me that I had signed up for the internship class and I might want to actually get an internship to go with it!

I looked at job sites and talked to some people but I wasn't terribly excited about what I found. There are lots of design internships but I really didn't want to be designing as my primary activity.

Metal Toad was not looking for interns, but from what I read and heard, it sounded like a place where I could learn a lot. And they do most of their development in Drupal, which is something I want to learn a lot more about and they're not afraid to <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/metal-toad-upgrade-html5-drupal7" target="_blank">live on the edge</a> of new technology. I went to the contact form on their site and wrote a short email, stating that I was a senior at the Art Institute, looking for an internship and what I had to offer.

I was surprised to get an email from CEO <a href="http://twitter.com/joaquinlippinco" target="_blank">Joaquin Lippincott</a> only ten minutes later. We had coffee a few days later and here I am.

There are a few things about this experience worth highlighting:
<h3><em>Ask and you shall receive. If you don't ask, the answer is always no. Don't die wondering.</em></h3>
Variations on this theme have gotten me a lot of amazing opportunities, including the chance to sing on stage with one of my favorite local musicians, on my birthday, in front of my mom and all my friends.

The place you want to work might not be looking for you...but maybe that's just because they don't know how awesome you are. Ask for what you want. The worst that can happen is nothing.
<h3><em>Don't wait till the last minute.</em></h3>
Yes, I know. It seems I didn't really follow this advice and that's sort of true. But I also have a year before I graduate so I'm not so desperate that I have to take the first thing that comes along. After a spring term job fair, I had one contact literally hounding me to come work for him. Desperation is never an attractive quality, whether you're the intern or the hiring company. This particular company wasn't in a field I'm interested in or qualified for--they just wanted someone to update their website for free.
<h3><em>Know what you want</em></h3>
I'm incredibly fortunate to have a scholarship that allows me to attend school full time and a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/5021328396/" target="_blank">smokin' hot sugar mama</a> who gives me a break on my rent. I wasn't limited to seeking out paid internships so I can continue to eat. This allowed me to focus on finding a position doing something I'm actually interested in. My primary goal was to surround myself with smart people who know lots more than I do about Drupal and were willing to share that knowledge (this last part is key!). I feel I've definitely succeeded on that front.

It's only been a couple of days, but I already have that overwhelmed feeling that usually precedes gaining +10 to geekiness.]]></content:encoded>

Five years ago tonight, I rolled into Jess's arms at Oaks Park roller rink on Gay Skate night. For the remainder of the evening, we rolled around the rink getting to know each other. I completely abandoned the group of friends I had assembled for gay skate (in case the date turned out to be a disaster), except for a single check in to report, "My skate date is hot!"

Recently a friend asked me if our relationship is 'as good as I make it sound,' and the truth is YES, it really is that good. I waited a long time and went through some crazy people and some looong dry spells. "The longer I wait, the better she has to be," was the deal I made with the universe and the universe delivered.

I once made a list of twenty-three qualities I wanted in a partner. Jess has twenty-two of them. We are ridiculously compatible on most levels, as our rather embarrassing (to her) penchant for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/1325113833/in/set-72157601865565508/">matching clothing</a> can attest.

Here are just a few things I've learned about her in the past five years:

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's easily annoyed.</strong> She doesn't have much patience for people who cut her off in traffic, badly designed products or misbehaving fellow bikers. But when the s--- hits the fan, there's no one I'd rather have at my side. Having your mom diagnosed with terminal cancer really puts a damper on the honeymoon phase. Jess somehow helped me stay (mostly) sane during the most traumatic time of my life and put up with my family at the same time. That's commitment.</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"> </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong> </strong></span>

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Retired from Snowboarding"]<strong><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3020/3042332537_0bc54d105d_m.jpg"><img title="Retired from Snowboarding" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3020/3042332537_0bc54d105d_m.jpg" alt="Jess in cast" width="240" height="180" /></a></strong>[/caption]

<strong>She's fragile. </strong>When I suggested three days of snowboarding lessons for our first anniversary, she tried to tell me that she is very unlucky. After our second day on the slopes, I found out what she meant. Since then I make sure she's covered in appropriate padding and signs a waiver for all dangerous sporting activities.

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's hardcore</strong>. I was a bit concerned, given item 2, that she decided to come with me to the Dirt Series women's mountain biking clinic this past summer despite not having a mountain bike and no previously expressed interest in anything other than easy trail riding. On Friday during our ride in Sisters on the way down, she was tired, winded (recently diagnosed with exercise induced asthma) and cautiously walking over half the obstacles on the trail. The next day after a morning's skill lessons, she was riding down advanced trails in Bend and<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ephany/4886128187/in/set-72157624620325828/"> attempting to ride skinny logs five feet off the ground</a> (that is video footage of me. I didn't see her attempt since we were in separate groups, but you can see how high it was). Sure, it didn't go so well, but I was so proud of her for trying, it didn't even matter. Not only that, but despite a chain ring gash that should have gotten stitches (I'll spare you the picture), she wrapped that sucker and came back for more the next day.</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's not as nice as you think</strong>. Many people are fooled by what I refer to as her nice-midwestern-girl-exterior but those who have spent enough time with her have gotten a peak at the tiny evil streak. As someone who's venn diagram is filled with 50% sarcasm, I like a little bit of bad.</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's mature. </strong> Here's a conversation I had with mom on Jess's 31st birthday: Mom: How old is she? Me: 31. Mom: Wow really? I thought she'd be older than you. She's so much more mature. I faked a certain amount of outrage but when you're right, you're right. Over time, she's managed to bring me a little closer to adulthood, and I like to think I've helped her regress in all the right ways.</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's romantic.</strong> Seriously. If you could see inside those cards, you'd have to call your dentist for an emergency cleaning from all the sweetness. </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's adventurous.</strong> Before I met Jess, I had talked about traveling a lot more than I'd actually done it. We're not jet setters by any means, but thanks largely to her, we've spent a lot of time exploring the amazingly gorgeous state we live in and parts nearby. Thanks to her I finally saw Crater Lake, and eventually rode my bike around it. Since we've met, we've been on camping trips (both by car and by bike), beach trips, taken the train to Vanacouver B.C. (with our bikes), visited friends and family in Denver and New Mexico. Because of her I've gotten back into cross country skiing (a nice safe snow sport), mountain biking and even started racing cyclocross (which she is forbidden to do--see item 2).  Someday we both want to ride our bikes across the country.</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong>She's an awesome photographer.</strong> I've taken more classes and gotten myself some fancy equipment but she has a natural eye for composition that makes me whine with envy. Generally if I get a compliment on a photo in my Flickr stream, it's one that she's taken. </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><strong> </strong></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>She gets things done. </strong>If Jess has a super power, it's her focus and determination when she decides to do something. Move to Portland. Buy a House. Put up a fence. Get the house painted. Plan a trip. Build a garden bed (OK, I did that 'cause her wrist was broken, but she totally organized, planned, researched and paid for it. I was just cheap labor). Each time a school term ends, she's ready with a list of projects that need doing and it's almost always something to make our house nicer. It was fitting that we spent part of the day today finally (after more than four years in this house!) putting pictures up on our walls. Yeah, we make a good team, but sadly neither one of us is all that motivated when it comes to decorating so it's taken a while. But thanks to a CanvasPop Groupon, we got some nice prints made of photos we took ourselves and now they're up and they look awesome. Maybe this milestone will help us keep the momentum going in that area.</span>

I could go on, but you get the drift. My girlfriend is pretty awesome and I'm pretty lucky to have her. Suffice to say, it's been an amazing five years and I'm looking forward to the next five. Oh and to all those girls who told me I was 'too good a friend to date'-- Jess wanted me to let you know that you really missed out.

		<title>How To Find A Web Development Job After (Or Before) Graduation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago I decided to make a 180 degree career turn and become a web devloper. At the time I was pretty good at using computers, but I had no programming experience aside from a few vague memories of typing in DOS statements in middle school. I still remember asking the web devloper in our office what CSS was and nodding along as if I understood the answer.</p>
<p>I've come a long way baby, but there were times when I wondered if I would ever know enough for someone to actually pay me to make websites. Luckily, I've been able to keep my fine coworkers here at Metal Toad from finding out that I still have no idea what I'm doing. Here are a few things I've learned along the way.</p>

<h2>Start Networking From Day One</h2>
<p>One of the reasons I chose the Art Institute of Portland was that it is located in the heart of Pearl District close to scores of agencies and also within easy distance of a lot of great networking opportunities. Many of our instructors are professionals who work in the industry&mdash;and that means you can pick their brains about what you need to know to be marketable. It is entirely possibly that your instructor may be your future boss, coworker or at least a reference.</p>

<p>While you're networking, don't forget about your fellow classmates. The ones who graduate or start working before you are the ones who will be able to recommend you to their bosses&mdash;unless you become known as the one who always slacks on team projects. Likewise, if you are hardworking and awesome people will remember that too. When Joaquin asked me if I knew someone who knew about search engine optimization and had excellent writing skills, one person came to mind immediately and <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/people/ben" title="Ben Martin | Metal Toad Media">now he works here too</a>.</p>

<h2>Put The <em>Your</em> in Your Education</h2>

<p>I figured out pretty early on that the term 'required' can actually be pretty flexible if you push on the sides of the box. In any college curriculum, there will be painful classes that you cannot escape. But when it comes to your core major, you should strive to study the things that interest you the most. Photography yanks my chain a lot more than typography and websites use both so I've squeezed as many photography classes into my elective slots as I could. If you want to learn about a topic that isn't offered, consider an independent study or an internship.</p>

<h2>Speaking of Interships...</h2>

<p>Internships are a great way to get real world experience but they can also be a great way for companies to scam free work out of you without teaching you much in return (which, by the way, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03intern.html" title="The Unpaid Intern, Legal or Not - NYTimes.com">is illegal</a>). Planning ahead can help you steer towards the former and avoid the latter. (Do as I say, not as I do). If you've reached the point in your education where you're starting to narrow your focus to specific technologies you'd like to learn, that is a great time to start looking for a company who can offer you real world experience in that area. In my case, I had gotten a taste of Drupal and knew I need to be hanging around some smart people who knew a lot more than I did. I was extremely lucky to get a great mentor who really enjoys sharing his knowledge. Chuck taught me more about Drupal in two days than I had learned in six months of taking classes. (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush" title="Drush | drupal.org">Drush</a>, anyone? Yes, thank you!)</p>

<p>What's that you say? The company you have your eye on isn't looking for interns? What does that have to do with anything? Get your notepad ready, I'm about to offer up a free Rule For Life. Ready? Here it is: <em>If you don't ask, the answer is always no.</em> Metal Toad wasn't looking for an intern, and in fact I was the first intern the company has ever had. I found this out on my second day when Chuck asked, &ldquo;So how did you talk Joaquin into this&mdash;he's been anti intern forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just asked. Specifically, I emailed and explained that I was a senior at the Art Institute who was eager to learn and was there anything <strong>I</strong> could do to help <strong>him</strong>? I got a reply in about 15 minutes from Joaquin, inviting me to meet. Once I had a meeting, I had to prove that I could actually be useful which brings me to my final point:</p>

<h2>Choose Your Tools, Learn Your Tools, Love Your Tools</h2>

<p>Remember way back in paragraph two, when I talked about picking the brains of your instructors/industry professionals? One of the most valuable lectures I ever heard was in my first CSS class (yes, I did finally learn what CSS is!). In the computer labs at AI, we are constrained to the limitations of the software offered, which means a lot of us end up learning to code in Dreamweaver. The professor took some time in our first class to let us know that no one in her professional environement uses Dreamweaver. Although it has evolved greatly as a program, it is still considered by many to be a <acronym title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> crutch for programmers who don't know what they're doing.</p>

<p>She strongly encouraged us to find and learn one of the many excellent text editors out there and said that most people in her office use Textmate. I made the commitment right then to try Textmate, and downloaded the free trial that week. The learning curve was STEEP, my homework took twice as long, if not more, but after few weeks of unlocking the features and memorizing keyboard shortcuts, I couldn't imagine living without it. I'm not going to tell you what editor to use&mdash;wars have been fought over less. Whether you're on <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/22-neat-code-editors-for-windows/" title="22 Neat Code Editors for Windows | Nettuts+">Windows</a> or <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/20-mac-apps-youll-use-every-day-editors-choice/" title="20 Mac Apps You&#8217;ll Use Every Day: Editor&#8217;s Choice | Nettuts+">Mac</a>, there is probably something out there that will float your boat.</p>

<p>In general, make a habit of keeping your ear to the ground and finding out what it being used in the industry, and then <strong>make an effort to learn those things&mdash;whether or not they are being taught in a classroom.</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few other tools that will help float you to the top of the candidate pile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start tracking your time. Even if it's just for homework assignments. You will develop the habit which will be one less thing to get used to when you start working. You can also celebrate as the time it takes for you to do the same tasks becomes shorter. <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/" title="Simple Online Time Tracking, Timesheet and Invoicing Software - Harvest">Harvest</a> seems to be the cool kid on the block right now. They offer a free account and have a complimentary iPhone app and dashboard widget for Mac.</li>

  <li>Learn a version control system. <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git - Fast Version Control System">Git</a> is hot hot hot right now. Yes, the command-line can be scary if you don't have any previous experience with it, but with <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/" title="Git Immersion - Brought to you by EdgeCase">beautiful amazing tutorials</a> and <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" title="Tower - The most powerful Git client for Mac">new powerful <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> clients</a>, you really have no excuse.</li>

  <li>It makes me sad to have to include this last item, but based on the two interventions I've had to initiate, I guess it needs to be said: Get a decent email address. No, Hotmail and AOL (I'm not kidding), don't count. At first I thought maybe I was being too judgemental about this, but I've asked around, and so far all the developers I talk to say they would have a hard time taking a developer with an AOL account seriously. I'm not the boss of you, but it's a good way to get your resume tossed in the recycle bin, so if you love trees, just bite the bullet and get yourself a nice Gmail or personal domain address.
</li>
</ul>

<p>When I showed up to my meeting to infiltrate my way into Metal Toad, I think the fact that I was already familiar with almost all the tools we use every day counted as much if not more than my knowledge of Drupal (which was not much). It showed initiative and willingingness to learn new things. That is something you can't teach in a classroom and something employers get excited about.</p>

		<title>Adventures in Ruby: Week 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Poor little neglected blog. I can tell you exactly when it went into a prolonged coma: Oct 6th, 2008. AIP Fall Term Begins. Goodbye to reading books that aren't assigned textbooks and goodbye to writing anything that won't be turned in to an instructor

Fortunately I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Also fortunately, this term seems to be all about writing so the least I can do is post some of it in this poor little ghost town.

Last term I dove into Ruby with an independent study of Ruby on Rails. There are not any full time instructors at school who know anything about Ruby, but fortunately, my coworker at the time, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/vosechu">@vosechu</a>, is a Ruby nut and was happy to stay late one evening and give me enough guidance to get my environment up and running. From there, I dove into <a title="Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorials | Essential Training" href="http://www.lynda.com/tutorial/55960?srchtrk=index%3A1%0Alinktypeid%3A2%0Aq%3Aruby%20on%20rails%0Apage%3A1%0As%3Arelevance%0Asa%3Atrue%0Aproducttypeid%3A2">12 hours of tutorials</a> from Lynda.com that actually were quite good. I went through almost the entire series in less than 48 hours and was able to get my first project up and running and learn a few things about setting up a database and running migrations.

But learning RoR before I actually studied the Ruby language is by any measure, a little backwards. So I was happy to see a Ruby course offered this term that starts from the beginning and builds up the basics.

When I started my first term at the Art Institute 3 years ago, I remember clearly Chappy telling us in the first class that if we got out school without knowing how to learn a programming language on our own, then they hadn't done their jobs. Now I understand what he was talking about. Having dipped my toe into the waters of Python, Javascript, PHP, SQL and Actionscript, there are many aspects of programming that are found across all these similar languages. Once you understand the structures and the concepts of programming, picking up a new language can be largely a matter of syntax. A loop is a loop is a loop after all.

There are a lot of basic principles I'm still learning so I'm definitely not past the struggling phase. But I do finally have the confidence to keep digging into things until I figure them out. The other thing I figured out pretty quickly is that if I have a problem, I am likely not the first one to have it. Google knows all, sees all, and until it turns on us in Skynet fashion, I continue to rely on it to learn from other people's mistakes (which I much prefer to making my own).

One thing I've noticed when I have the chance to observe people who have been programming for a while is that they tend to be heavy users of the Terminal or Unix shell. When I started as an intern at <a title="Metal Toad Media | is a digital strategy partner." href="http://www.metaltoad.com/">Metal Toad</a>, Chuck blew my mind with all the things that were possible with the terminal and I've been a devoted user ever since. I'm not doing anything earth shattering, but it has been useful to at least get more comfortable with the basic commands, and it's been great for getting cozy with Git, which I now use every day. The <a title="UNIX / Linux Tutorial for Beginners" href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">Unix tutorials</a> that Steve gave us in the first week, are some of the clearest and simplest explainations I've seen. If you're interested in dipping your toe in, I definitely recommend it.

I also found <a title="Ruby Tutorials | Ruby Essential Training" href="http://www.lynda.com/tutorial/47905?srchtrk=index%3A4%0Alinktypeid%3A2%0Aq%3Aruby%20on%20rails%0Apage%3A1%0As%3Arelevance%0Asa%3Atrue%0Aproducttypeid%3A2">just under 7 hours of Ruby Essential Training</a> on Lynda.com. I know a lot of students might not have the budget to spend $25/month on a tutorial site when there's so much out there for free. For me, I don't really learn practical things that well from programming books. I've been a devoted fan of Nettuts since my second term of school. Being able to follow along with what is happening, and having a pause button, are a lot more valuable for me when I'm trying to learn something new.

So far I haven't gotten too far with the actual Ruby tuts that Steve assigned for week one but <a title="Ruby Essentials - Techotopia" href="http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Essentials">this one</a> looks pretty good (and it's free). I have a habit of trying to extend my school break by an extra week and scheduled a ton of social activities, including an out of town guest who left today. It's been an extra busy week, keeping up with my two compressed (5.5 week) online classes (procrastination is so not an option with remote classes). Yeah, I should have done one at a time, but I'd rather get the pain over with early and not have a four class pile up at the end of the term like last time. Now that I work three days a week on top of all of this, I've become one of those insane people that I looked at when I started here and wondered A) how they did it and B) if they slept at all.

I guess I've figured out the answer at least for me is, A) Because I really want to graduate in September instead of December so I can get my freaking life back and B) Not much.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week was a big all over the map. Part of me really wants to dive into the <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/?s=Vim">Vim tutorials</a> series on Nettuts...but I feel like I've spent most of my education trying to master tools at the expense of actually learning whatever language or framework I'm supposed to be immersed in. I've put in my time with Textmate and I still have only scratched the surface of what it can do--with a dull nail at that--so I'm gonna resist editor-jumping for another little while yet.

Instead I spent some time reviewing the notes from our Ruby class page and trying to wrap my head around the different methods of calling Ruby methods, working with classes etc. It still freaks me out that there are NO SEMICOLONS ANYWHERE. But I also kind of like it.

I'm still not convinced the merits of <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a>, despite the glowing reviews of the Haml fans. At this point I think it's good to know it exists, but again, I already know HTML quite well and piling on an abstraction layer while I'm trying to learn the basics of a new language seems like asking for some ::headdesk:: in the not-to-distant future.

I'm still trying to figure out the best way for me to learn things in a way that I will actually retain them. I spent some time with the Ruby Essentials training on Lynda.com this week. They're very well done, but it can feel slow at times and I ended up skipping some things because I got bored.

The most interesting find of the week was the <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> which follows a teaching Ruby through Ruby testing method unlike any tutorials I've ever seen.  I've been around long enough to understand the concept of building an app through testing. You write tests for what you need to build, they fail and then you write code until you pass the tests. But for a n00b programmer, the thought of writing tests when you can barely write a function, much less a Class, is pretty overwhelming. I thought this was a pretty unique approach to getting at the concept in a really manageable way.

I've also been looking into Capistrano, although that's not strictly related to the Ruby/Sinatra focus of class. Even though I use it daily at work, I haven't yet had time to implement it for any of my personal projects. And now that I know it's there, I get really bitter about my slow and painful deployment methods!

I'm supposed to come up with a project to work on for the rest of the term. I've been thinking about it, but nothing earth shattering has come to mind. Last term I was fortunate to have a <a href="http://wdig.kronda.com">project</a> I was really passionate about--mostly because I really needed it and the existing tool was beyond crap. I even dabbled in Rails with that project, but if it is going to be truly usable for my school, I'm going to have to make it into a PHP-based app. And I would really like to leave it as a gift to future confused students trying to make it to the finish line.

I already dabbled in <a href="http://waronpink.kronda.com/">hand coding my own blog</a> too. My current state of overwhelmedness is probably contributing to my lack of inspiration. There's a sample project on the Lynda.com tut that is a restaurant finder. That might be a good project to try. The tutorial walks through creating a command line based app. Maybe I could go through that and then apply to Sinatra.

The only other thought I've had so far is some kind of online recipe book. That's not really something I need since I already have an app that works well for that--but it's a least something I might find interesting, since my partner and I are really into cooking right now, mostly from <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com">this site</a>.

So that's all from the idea factory so far. Survived 2 weeks of online classes so far with 3.5 weeks to go. What doesn't kill me... blah blah blah.
