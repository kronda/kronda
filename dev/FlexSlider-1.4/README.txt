Changelog:

v1.4 (2011-08-23)
  - Added "manualControls" property to allow for custom, non-dynamic control navigation
  - Added "show" animation to allow for instant transitions between slides

v1.3 (2011-08-18)
  - Made slide animation a continuous scroll effect, rather than jumping back to start/end
  - Cleaned up code and created better test cases for different slider scenarios. The slider is a lot more bulletproof as of this update.
